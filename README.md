## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to align the div tag using flexbox. 

I learned how to divide the project into sections, using header, body and footer.

### Continued development

I would still need to refine and enhance my css designs and properties and I would need to work on that.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - I really liked this site for font selection and would be using this going forward.
